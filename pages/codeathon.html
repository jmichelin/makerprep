        Exercise 1: Holes in the text

        Johnny wrote some text on a piece of paper and now he wants to know how many holes are in the text.
        What is a hole? If you think of the paper as the plane and a letter as a curve on the plane, then
        each letter divides the plane into regions. For example letters "A", "D", "O", "P", "R" divide the
        plane into two regions so we say these letters each have one hole. Similarly, letter "B" has two
        holes and letters such as "C", "E", "F", "K" have no holes. Today we will be treating “B” as if it
        only had one hole. We say that the number of holes in the text is equal to the total number of holes
        in the letters of the text. Help Johnny to determine how many holes are in the text.

        Sample Input:

        Bonanza.

        Sally caught crabs.

        Sample Output:

        There are 4 hole(s) in your input: B, o, a, a

        There are 5 hole(s) in your input: a, a, g, a, b

        Implementation:

        Prompt the user to enter a sentence (or just hard-code the sentence).
        Create a hasHole function that has a ‘letter’ parameter and returns whether the letter contains a ‘hole’ or not.
        Use your filter in combination with your hasHole function to create a new array containing the letters with ‘holes’ in them.
        Print the number of holes in the string as well as what these ‘holy’ letters are.

        Exercise 2: Sidekicks & Super Heroes

        var sidekicks = [
        {name: "Robin",           hero: "Batman"   },
        {name: "Supergirl",       hero: "Superman" },
        {name: "Fatman",          hero: "Mister America"},
        {name: "Oracle",          hero: "Batman"   },
        {name: "Doiby Dickles",   hero: "Green Lantern" },
        {name: "BatGirl",         hero: "Batman"},
        {name: "Pieface",         hero: "Green Lantern" }
        ];
        a. Use your filter function on the sidekicks array and return any sidekick whose hero is 'Batman'.

        b. Use your map function combined with your filter function to return only the names of the sidekicks whose heroes are 'Green Lantern'.

        Exercise 3: Contains?

        Write a contains function that returns whether or not something is contained in a collection.

        Implementation:

        Use your reduce function inside your contains function.
        * Hint: remember which variables you have at your disposal.

        Exercise 4: MakerSquare gold coins

        In MakerSquare they have a very strange monetary system. Each MakerSquare gold coin has an integer number written on it. A coin n can be exchanged in a bank into three coins: n/2, n/3 and n/4 (a coin n can be turned into n/2 + n/3 + n/4). But these numbers are all rounded down (the banks have to make a profit). You can also sell MakerSquare coins for American dollars. The exchange rate is 1:1. But you can not buy MakerSquare coins. If a user enters the value of their MakerSquare coins, what is the maximum amount of American dollars they can get for them?

        Sample Input:

        Enter the MKS coins you wish to convert to USD separated by spaces. // 12 2

        Sample Output:

        Your 12 MakerSquare coin translates to 13 American dollar(s).

        Your 2 MakerSquare coin translates to 1 American dollar(s).

        Explanation:

        You can change 12 into 6, 4 and 3, and then change these into $6 + $4 + $3 = $13.

        If you try changing the coin 2 into 3 smaller coins, you will get 1, 0 and 0, and later you can get no more than $1 out of them.

        It is better just to change the 2 coin directly into $2.

        Implementation:

        Prompt the user to enter the coins they wish to exchange (or just hard-code it).
        Convert the return from that prompt into an array containing only numbers.
        Use your map function to iterate over the array and produce a new array of the converted values of the coins.
        Tell the user what their MakerSquare gold coins convert to.

        Exercise 5: The Next Palindrome

        A positive integer is called a palindrome if its representation in the decimal system is the same when read from left to right and from right to left. For a given positive integer K of not more than 1000000 digits, write the value of the smallest palindrome larger than K to output. Numbers are always displayed without leading zeros.

        Implementation:

        Prompt the user to enter their test numbers (or just hard-code them).
        Use your map function to iterate over the elements of the array and return the smallest palindrome larger than the current number.
        It may help to create a function to test if a number is a palindrome or return the smallest palindrome larger than the number.
        Sample Input:

        Please enter your numbers separated by spaces. // 808 2133

        Sample Output:

        The smallest palindrome larger than 808 is 818.

        The smallest palindrome larger than 2133 is 2222.

        Exercise 6: Closing the Tweets

        Little kids, Jack and Evan like playing their favorite game Glass-and-Stone. Today they want to play something new and came across Twitter on their father's laptop. They saw it for the first time but were already getting bored to see a bunch of sentences having at most 140 characters each. The only thing they liked to play with it is, closing and opening tweets.

        There are N tweets on the page and each tweet can be opened by clicking on it, to see some statistics related to that tweet. Initially all the tweets are closed. Clicking on an open tweet closes it and clicking on a closed tweet opens it. There is also a button to close all the open tweets. Given a sequence of K clicks by Jack, Evan has to guess the total number of open tweets just after each click. Please help Evan in this game.

        Sample Input:

        How many tweets are there? // 3

        Which tweet(s) would you like to click on? Enter 'c' for 'close all' or 'o' for 'open all'. Separate each 'click' with a space. // 1 2 3 2 c 1

        Sample Output:

        Tweets: 1, 0, 0

        1 tweet(s) are open

        Explanation:

        Let open[x] = 1 if the xth tweet is open and 0 if its closed.

        Initially open[1..3] = { 0 , 0 , 0 }. Here is the state of open[1..3] after each click and corresponding count of open tweets.

        CLICK 1 : { 1, 0, 0 }, open count = 1

        CLICK 2 : { 1, 1, 0 }, open count = 2

        CLICK 3 : { 1, 1, 1 }, open count = 3

        CLICK 2 : { 1, 0, 1 }, open count = 2

        CLOSEALL : { 0, 0, 0 }, open count = 0

        OPENALL : { 1, 1, 1 }, open count = 3

        Implementation:

        Prompt the user for the number of tweets there will be and store it in numberOfTweets.

        Prompt the user for the tweets they would like to click, or have them enter ‘o’ to open all of them or ‘c’ to close all of them (store these in an array called postClicks.

        Create a createEmptyArray function that takes a number as input and returns an array of that size and enters ‘0’ for each value of the array.

        Create an allOpen function that takes an array as a parameter and using ‘map’ (the function you created earlier) returns that array filled with the number 1. This is for when the user enters an 'o'.

        Create an allClosed function that takes an array as a parameter and using ‘map’ (the function you created earlier) returns that array filled with the number 0. This is for when the user enters a 'c'.

        Use your ‘each’ function (the function you created earlier) to iterate over your postClicks array that either opens/closes all the tweets or toggles specific tweets.

        Create a function getCount that takes an array as a parameter and using reduce (the function you created earlier) returns the sum of the array. This is to find out how many tweets are open.

        Log which tweets are open (in array format).
