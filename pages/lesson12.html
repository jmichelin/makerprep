    Exercise 1

    Write a function answer_logger that takes a function as input, runs it, and console logs the return value from that function.
    We can test answer_logger using the following code, we should not need to change it at all.

    answer_logger(function(){
      return "I should be console logged";
    });
    Notice anything interesting about the function declaration above? The function has no name and its not assigned to a variable. In JavaScript a function that was declared without any named identifier is called an "anonymous function", and is usually not accessible after its initial creation.
    Anonymous functions are commonly used in functional programming when the only purpose of a function is to be passed as a parameter to another function. There is no need to give the function a name or assign it to a variable; the anonymous function will only be accessed by the function it is being passed to, and that function will be able to reference it by the name of the parameter. This will become more clear with practice. A function, anonymous or otherwise, that has been passed as an argument to another function is called a callback, because at some point the function it was passed to will "call it back".
  </pre>
  <pre>
    Exercise 2

    Write a function called answer_collector that takes an array of functions as an input and runs each of them in turn.
    Each time you run a function, capture its return value and push it to a results_array.
    Return the results array from answer_collector.

    Your code should look something like this:

    var answer_collector = function(functions_array) {
      //create array called results_array

      /*loop through functions in functions_array, invoke each of them
      and store the returned values in results_array*/

      //return results_array when complete
    }
    We can test answer_collector with this code:

    var fn1 = function () {
      return "this should be the first value in results array";
    };

    answer_collector([fn1, function(){ return "this should be the second value in results array" }]);
    Returning Functions from Functions

    Not only can functions be passed as inputs, they can also be returned as outputs.

    var returns_a_func = function () {
      return function(){ console.log('BOOP!') };
    };

    // have we booped yet?
    var booper = returns_a_func();

    // how about now?
    booper();

    booper();
    booper();
    booper();
  </pre>
  <pre>
    Exercise 3

    Create a function that returns another function.
    The returned function should accept one parameter and return 5 + parameter when it is invoked.
    Your code should look something like this:

    var add_five = function() {
      //return a function that accepts one parameter and returns 5 + parameter
      return function(num1) { return num1 + 5; }
    }
    You can test your function with this code:

    var add_fiver = add_five();
    console.log(add_fiver(5)); //should print 10
    console.log(add_fiver(3)); //should print 8
  </pre>
  <pre>
    Exercise 4

    Write a function secret_keeper that defines a variable secret inside its code block.
    Try to access the secret variable from outside the function scope using your JS console. Make sure it's safe!
    Allow the user to invoke secret_keeper with two strings as arguments
    Print the two strings with the secret word between them.
    Scope

    JavaScript has two scopes: global and local. A variable that is declared outside a function definition is a global variable, and its value is accessible and modifiable anywhere in your program.

    A variable that is declared inside a function definition, on the other hand, is local. It is created and destroyed every time the function is executed, and it cannot be accessed by code outside the function.

    var global_variable = 'Hello world!';

    function just_a_regular_function() {
      var local_variable = 'Hello local scope!'
      console.log(local_variable);
    }

    // print 'Hello world!'
    console.log(global_variable);

    // prints undefined
    console.log(local_variable);

    // prints 'Hello local scope!'
    just_a_regular_function();
    Functions define their own local scope. Variables declared within a function invocation are available only inside of that function.

    It's as if function invocations are surrounded by one-way mirrors, they can see out and access variables named in their parent scope, but code running outside can't see in to access parameters or variables defined inside. Try this out, don't copy and paste:
  </pre>
  <pre>
    Exercise 5

    Write two versions of a function adds_10
    The first version of the function, adds_10 should print the result of adding 10 to a global variable number, but should not modify it.
    The second version of the function, leaky_adds_10 should increase the value of a global variable number, and then print the new value of number
  </pre>
  <pre>
    Closure

    Returned functions retain access to the scope that was available to them when they were defined. This is called closure.

    Read that again.

    When a function is defined, the scope that is available to it is established at the point where the keyword function is written, not where it is invoked.

    This is incredibly important, please don't move on until you understand this concept. Ask the instructor for help you if need to!

    Exercise 6

    Write a function multiplies_by that takes a number as input and returns a function that,
    when invoked with a second number as an argument, multiplies the two numbers together.
  </pre>
  <script>
  /////////////////
  //Exercise 6
  ////////////////
  var multiplies_by = function(number) {
    // Store number parameter
    var parameter = number;
    /* Return function that accepts one parameter and returns
    the result of multiplying parameter by stored number above */
    return function(number2){ return number * number2 }
  }
  var times5 = multiplies_by(5);
  console.log(times5(4)); // 20

  var times10 = multiplies_by(10);
  console.log(times10(32)); // 320
  /////////////////
  //Exercise 5
  ////////////////
  // Define number here
  var number = 10;
  var adds_10 = function() {
    // Print number + 10
    //console.log(number + 10);
  };

  var leaky_adds_10 = function() {
    // Increase number by 10
    number += 10;
    // Print number
    //console.log(number);
  }
  var number = 10;

  // Prints 20
  adds_10();

  // Number is still 10
  //console.log("number 10?" + number);

  // Prints 20
  leaky_adds_10();

  // Number has been changed to 20
  //console.log(number);

  ////////////////
  //Exercise 4
  ////////////////
  var secret_keeper = function(string1, string2) {
    // Define secret string here
    var secretString = "RAMBO";
    // Console log both strings with secret between them here
    //console.log(string1 + secretString + string2);
  }
  secret_keeper("blah blah blah", "blah blah blah");
  // Try to access secret here (you should not be able to)

  // Invoke the secret_keeper function, this should print the secret string

  ////////////////
  //Exercise 3
  ////////////////
  var add_five = function() {
    //return a function that accepts one parameter and returns 5 + parameter
    return function(num1) { return num1 + 5; }
  }
  var add_fiver = add_five();
  //console.log(add_fiver(5)); //should print 10
  //console.log(add_fiver(3)); //should print 8
  ////////////////
  //Exercise 2
  ////////////////
  var answer_collector = function(functions_array) {
    //create array called results_array
    results_array = [];
    /*loop through functions in functions_array, invoke each of them
    and store the returned values in results_array*/
    for (i=0; i<functions_array.length;i++) {
      results_array += functions_array[i]();
    }
    return results_array
  }
  var fn1 = function () {
    return "this should be the first value in results array";
  };

  console.log(answer_collector([fn1, function(){ return "this should be the second value in results array" }]));

  ////////////////
  //Exercise 1
  ////////////////
  function answer_logger(func) {
    console.log(func());
  }
  answer_logger(function(){
    return "I should be console logged";
  });
